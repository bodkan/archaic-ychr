* The evolutionary history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y chromosomes

This repository contains the code used in the 2020 paper "The
evolutionary history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y chromosomes" by
Petr /et al./, which you can read [[https://www.biorxiv.org/...][here]].

** Contents

This repository contains:

- a complete data processing pipeline - processing of BAM files,
  genotype calling, etc. (=Makefile=);
- scripts used for processing and simulations (=src/=) and R
  code used for all analyses (=R/=);
- R Jupyter notebooks used to generate every result in the paper
  (notebooks in =notebooks/=);
- cached results in the [[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/readRDS.html][rds format]] - useful for re-producing all
  tables and figures in the paper without having to first re-process
  sequencing data or run SLiM simulations (=data/rds/=).

Note that the repository is structured as any other [[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/][R package]], with
the exception that it contains not only the required R package
components (R code in =R/=, the =DESCRIPTION= file etc.), but also the
data and analyses themselves. Therefore, if you clone this repository
and [[https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de][download the sequence data]], you can simply call
=devtools::load_all(".")= from the root of the repository and
immediately start working with the data.

All software dependencies used in the project are described in detail
in [[https://github.com/bodkan/archaic-ychr/blob/master/notebooks/software_versions.ipynb][this notebook]].

** Data availability

In addition to cached results in =data/rds= in this repository, all
sequencing data (BAM/VCF/FASTA files) as well as the sequences of
capture probes can be found at:
https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/archaic-ychr.
