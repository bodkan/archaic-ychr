* The evolutionary history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y chromosomes

This repository contains all computational analyses used in the 2020
paper "The evolutionary history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y
chromosomes" by Petr /et al./, which you can read [[https://www.biorxiv.org/...][here]].

** Contents

You can find here:

- my complete data processing and data-generation pipeline -
  processing of BAM files, genotype calling, simulations
  etc. (=Makefile=);
- scripts used by the =Makefile= pipeline (=src/=) and R functions
  used for analyses (=R/=);
- R [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter notebooks]] used to generate every result in the paper
  (=notebooks/=);
- cached results in the [[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/readRDS.html][rds format]] - useful for re-producing all
  tables and figures in the paper without having to first re-process
  sequencing data or run SLiM simulations (=data/rds/=).

Note that the repository is structured as an [[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/][R package]], with the
exception that it contains not only the required R package components
(R code in =R/=, the =DESCRIPTION= file etc.), but also the data and
analyses themselves. Therefore, after cloning this repository, you can
simply call =devtools::load_all(".")= from the root of the repository
in an R console and immediately start exploring the data yourself.

All software dependencies used in the project are described in detail
in [[https://github.com/bodkan/archaic-ychr/blob/master/notebooks/software_versions.ipynb][this notebook]].

** Data availability

In addition to cached results in =data/rds= in this repository, all
sequencing data (BAM/VCF/FASTA files), raw simulation outputs, as well
as the sequences of capture probes can be found at:
https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/archaic-ychr.
