* The evolutionary history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y chromosomes

This repository contains code used in the 2020 paper "The evolutionary
history of Neandertal and Denisovan Y chromosomes" by Petr _et al._,
which you can read [[https://www.biorxiv.org/...][here]].

You can find here:

- our complete data processing pipeline - BAM file processing,
  genotype calling, FASTA file generation, etc. (=Makefile=);
- R Jupyter notebooks with _code used to generate every result in the
  paper_ (notebooks in =notebooks/=);
- cached results in an [[https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/readRDS.html][rds format]] - you can use those to re-produce
  all tables and figures in the paper without having to first
  re-process all raw sequencing data or running all SLiM simulations
  (=data/rds/=).

Note that the repository is structured as any other [[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/][R package]], with
the exception that it contains not only all the required R package
components (R code in =R/=, the =DESCRIPTION= file etc.), but also the
analysis and plotting pipelines which use the code of this
package. Therefore, if you clone this repository and [[https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de][download the
data]], you can simply call =devtools::load_all(".")= from the root of
the repository in an R console or in any R Jupyter notebook and
immediately start working with the data.

All dependencies and versions of the software are described in detail
in [[https://github.com/bodkan/archaic-ychr/blob/master/notebooks/software_versions.ipynb][this notebook]].
